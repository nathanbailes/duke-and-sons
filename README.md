# Duke & Sons Tree Trimming — Website

A fast, responsive, single‑page site for your business. Everything is static (HTML/CSS/JS) so you can host it anywhere for free.

## Quick start
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. To go live, drag the whole folder into one of these (free) hosts:
   - **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, upload files, then Settings → Pages → Deploy from `main`.
   - **Netlify**: Drag‑and‑drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - **Vercel**: Create a new project and import the folder.

## Customize
- **Phone & email**: Search for `(352) 281-6533` and `DukeAndSonsTreeTrimming@gmail.com` in `index.html` and `main.js`.
- **Service areas, hours, text**: Edit `index.html` sections.
- **Colors & styles**: Tweak CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- **Logo**: Replace `assets/logo.svg` with your own file (keep the same filename).

## Contact form
This build uses a `mailto:` link so the visitor’s email app opens with the request pre‑filled. If you want a backend or no‑email‑app requirement:
- **Formspree** or **Netlify Forms**: Both work without code changes except the form `action` attribute and a hidden input. I can wire it up for you.

## SEO
- Clean titles & meta descriptions.
- LocalBusiness JSON‑LD for better local results.
- Mobile‑friendly and fast.

## Notes
- No external libraries — simple, fast, and easy to maintain.
- Accessibility‑first: semantic HTML, keyboard‑friendly navigation, visible focus states.
